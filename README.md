### Hi, I'm Eric

- 📖 I'm working on a CS master's through the 🟧 University of Illinois 🟦 (some [class](https://github.com/EricSchrock/zurg) [projects](https://github.com/EricSchrock/co2-monitor)).
- 🤔 I'm currently learning Go.
- 🌱 I love mentoring young and aspiring software engineers. [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend) is currently my go to recommendation for beginners.
- 👍 I enjoyed and would recommend these online courses on [machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), [sensor fusion](https://www.udacity.com/course/sensor-fusion-engineer-nanodegree--nd313), [cryptography](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto), and [modern C++](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213).
